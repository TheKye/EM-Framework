# EM-Framework

EM Framework is the main framework used by all the EM Mods

EM Framework is also a great util for server owners and modders as it contains a whole bunch of methods setup for modders to make use of super easily


# Code Practice

All PRs should come from your own fork and be PR'd in

Main Repo will contain these Branches:

- Main - Main Branch - Should not be working in this branch
- Staging - All Prs should go to this branch
- user-x - Branch should be based on staging and then pr from this branch into staging
- Release - Release state
- Rework - Refactoring/Rework branch
- Version x - Staging Builds for the next Eco Version

Please do not code rip or redistribue code found in the EM Framework

Nuget Packages are manually added by me but can be found here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElixrMods.Framework/

We also understand its easy to recreate systems in your own ways, there are some parts of code in the framework that have been absorbed from other mods with permission from those creators
